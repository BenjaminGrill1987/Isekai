Welcome to Guildmaker7 templates!

These are 7 chunky-styled sprites of various sizes for users who want a little more detail in their characters but are wary of the hurdle of actually drawing all those walking frames. Use them in any engine!

Features an asesprite animation file and a PSD with the frames as layers, so you don't have to run around in-game to find any wayward jumping pixels.

Also features two palette files, for both ease of replacing colours and for some interesting colour suggestions. The first is a basic palette selection, the second is a 55-colour limited version using Grafxkid's Nature's Bounty palette.
